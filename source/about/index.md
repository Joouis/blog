# 关于我

你好，我是 John Chou，欢迎来到我的个人空间。你也可以叫我 **Joou**，因为这个世界上有太多的 John，很容易“撞库”，因此我以轴对称取了 "John Chou" 的左右各两个字母，创造了这样一个少见的绰号。不过在世界上的某个角落，同样有人使用这个词作为他们的代号，这使我不得不再思考一番，加上 "is" 这个后缀来作为网站的域名：想了解我是谁，来 [joouis.com](https://blog.joouis.com/about) 就知道了 LOL

我是科技宅，音乐控特别是爵士相关的吉他和说唱，曼联球迷，VIM 爱好者。年少焊得一手好电路（中考时因获湖北省无线电制作大赛一等奖而加分，大学时期拿过全国大学生电子设计竞赛省一），沉迷嵌入式技术。然而毕业加入阿里即被拥抱变化转行 F2E，开始踏上漫漫互联网征程。

我目前专注 Web 前端工程开发，就职于微软中国 STCA。业务经验主要有工程效率工具和全球化电商平台的开发，技术背景覆盖 PC 软件、PC Web 到 Mobile H5/Hybrid 开发的解决方案。

如果你需要内推进入微软、阿里巴巴的帮助，可以通过 [E-mail](mailto:luckyjoou@gmail.com) 方式联系我。当然其他**有趣**的话题也欢迎来聊。

愿你有美好的一天！



# About me

Hi, this is John Chou, welcome to my personal space. You can call me **Joou** as well, I extract both two left and right letters in "John Chou" symmetrically and combine them into this nickname, because there are too many John in the world, which could make "hash collision" easily. But still some Joou existed in somewhere, so I add a suffix "is" with "joou" as my website domain, it means if you want to know who is Joou, just visit [joouis.com](https://blog.joouis.com/about) LOL

I like cool new techs, music especially Jazz standard and Jazz Hip hop, guitar, Manchester United and VIM. I love embedded system stuffs, as I won the first prize of Radio Production Contest in Hubei province when I was in junior high school as well as the first prize of National Undergraduate Electronics Design Contest in Shandong division, and obtained EE master degree in NCKU.

But I was asked to embrace changes (which is one of the most important cultures in Alibaba) to be a F2E developer after I joined YunOS immediately... Thus I'm focused on web front-end engineer currently, working for Machine Learning platform in Microsoft. Prior to that, I worked for Alibaba more than 2 years, developed Lazada E-commercial platform for seller part from PC web to mobile H5/Hybrid app and YunOS IDE with related tools across popular PC platforms.

If you want a referral for joining Microsoft or Alibaba, just contact me via [E-mail](mailto:luckyjoou@gmail.com). Any friendly and **interesting** discussion is also welcomed.

Have a great day!
