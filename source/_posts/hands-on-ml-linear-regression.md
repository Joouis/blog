## Recap of basic concepts

Do not worry about these theories if you can't catch up, just take it as an intro, this post will not introduce too many math knowledges also.

### Steps of machine learning

- Define the model, like linear model or neural network.
- Define the goodness/loss of model above, metrics can be error, cross entropy, etc.
- Calculate the best function by optimization algorithms.

### Linear model

Let's use simplest linear model as exmaple.
